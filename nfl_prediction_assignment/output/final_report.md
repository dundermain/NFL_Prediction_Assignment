Based on the performance summary provided, several key factors need to be considered when predicting the outcome of the Jaguars vs. Jets game on December 15. Both teams have identical records of 4-12, suggesting a competitive matchup. However, the New York Jets seem to have a slight edge.

1. **Injuries and Player Changes:**
   - The Jaguars are significantly impacted by injuries, particularly with Walker Little and Ventrell Miller, affecting both their offensive and defensive lines. Brandon Scherff's limited participation is another concern.
   - The Jets, while also facing challenges, primarily need to focus on Aaron Rodgers' health. If Rodgers is fit and able to play effectively, the Jets could have a stronger offensive performance.

2. **Current Season and Past Performance:**
   - Both teams have had inconsistent performances this season. The Jaguars, while promising offensively, struggle defensively. Conversely, the Jets have a robust defense but face challenges in offensive consistency.

3. **Coaching Strategies:**
   - The Jaguars need to leverage Trevor Lawrence's passing abilities while addressing defensive shortcomings.
   - The Jets will likely focus on their defensive strategies, with Aaron Rodgers playing a crucial role. Enhancing red-zone efficiency will be key for the Jets.

4. **Environmental Factors:**
   - The game is at MetLife Stadium, giving the Jets a home-field advantage. Forecasted cool temperatures and moderate winds could favor the Jets, who are accustomed to such conditions. The Jaguars may need to adjust to the cooler environment.

**Probability of Winning:**
Considering the factors above, I estimate:
- **New York Jets**: 55% probability of winning, due to their strong defense, home-field advantage, and familiarity with weather conditions.
- **Jacksonville Jaguars**: 45% probability of winning, with a chance to capitalize on offensive plays and if they manage to overcome defensive and environmental challenges.

This analysis indicates a close game, with the Jets having a slight advantage due to the outlined factors.
