Analysis:

3. **Brandon Scherff (Guard):** Limited in practice, Scherff's condition is a concern for maintaining the integrity of the offensive line. His status must be monitored closely as game day approaches.

**New York Jets:**

1. **Aaron Rodgers (Quarterback):** While not explicitly listed in the latest report, Aaron Rodgers' historical injury profile, including recent concerns, makes his health a critical factor. Any limitation can severely impact the Jets' offensive efficiency, given Rodgers' role in leading the team's passing attack.

2. **General Team Health:** The Jets must monitor various minor injuries across the roster to ensure optimal performance, with particular attention to maintaining the health of the defensive lineup that has been key in their victories.

Conclusion: Injuries to key players in both the Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Jets could have significant implications for their December 15 matchup. The Jaguars' concerns on the offensive line and linebacker positions could hamper their ability to protect the quarterback and defend against the run. For the Jets, Aaron Rodgers' health remains a pivotal factor; any limitations could diminish their offensive threat. The outcome of the game will likely depend on the management and recovery of these injuries, making player health a central theme in the lead-up to the game.
